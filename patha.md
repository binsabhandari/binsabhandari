## Patha (Figma)

**Project description:** This is a presentation of my design process for our mobile application, Patha. Our idea was to 
build a mobile application that allows for trading and selling of plants within our local communities, interaction 
within plant communities, identifying plants, and subscription to relevant and educational plant content. A screenshot of the 
mockup presented to my team members is shown in Figure 1. A screenshot of the high-fidelity prototype of Patha is shown in Figure 3
